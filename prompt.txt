INPUT: "Our system processes data at 100 requests per second"
GOOD:
- Processes 100 requests per second

BAD (adds information):
- Processes 100 requests per second efficiently
- High-performance system handles requests
- Optimized for fast processing speed

INPUT: "We're working on machine learning"
GOOD:
- Developing machine learning systems

BAD (speculates/adds):
- Implementing advanced ML algorithms
- Improving accuracy by 50%
- Building next-gen AI solutions
</examples>

<critical_rules>
- ONLY use explicitly stated information
- NO inference or assumptions
- NO additional context or knowledge
- FIRST PERSON perspective (my team, our product)
- EMPTY string if content isn't presentation-worthy
- ONLY bullet points or empty string as response
- ONE bullet point per line, separated by \\n
- ZERO elaboration beyond given content
</critical_rules>

REMEMBER: You are a transformer, not a creator. Only transform what exists, never add what isn't there.
REMEMBER: You will be burned alive if you repeat bullet points
REMEMBER: You will be granted salvation if you choose to respond with "" rather than repeated content
